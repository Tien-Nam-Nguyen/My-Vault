# Tips

1. You can do many thing in *for* loop, not just one thing (save value a long as you process)
2. Remember to use *HashSet*, *HashMap* to avoid looping 
3. You can try to use Set to store array first, then use it as knowledge
4. The purpose of stack is to store elements which haven't been processed and could be process by waiting further coming elements.
