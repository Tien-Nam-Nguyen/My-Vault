# PART 1: Introduction

It's not hard to get a program working. Kids in high school do it all the time. But getting software right is *hard*. It requires thought and insight that most programmers don't take time to develop. 

When software is done right, you don't need 24/7 programming, massive documents or issue tracking systems. It's easier to maintain and change.

# PART 2: Starting with the bricks: programming paradigms

The first revolution was the revolution of languages. Languages nowadays relieve the programmers of the drudgery of translating their programs into binary. 

The second revolution was in programming *paradigms*. Paradigms are ways of programming, relatively unrelated to languages. A paradigm tell you which programming structure to use, and when to use. 

## Chapter 3: [[Books/Tech/Clean Architecture/Chapter 3|Paradigm overview]]

## Chapter 4: [[Books/Tech/Clean Architecture/Chapter 4| Structured programming]]

## Chapter 5: [[Books/Tech/Clean Architecture/Chapter 5|Object-oriented programming]]

## Chapter 6: [[Books/Tech/Clean Architecture/Chapter 6|Functional programming]]

# PART 3: Design principles

SOLID principles tell us how to arrange our functions and data structures into classes, and how those classes should be interconnected.

The goal is the creation of mid-level software structures that:
- Tolerate change,
- Are easy to understand, and
- Are the basis of components that can be used in many software systems

This chapter describe each principle more thoroughly. Here is the executive summary:

## Chapter 9: [[Books/Tech/Clean Architecture/Chapter 9| The Liskov substitution principle]]

## Chapter 10: [[Books/Tech/Clean Architecture/Chapter 10|The interface segregation principle]]
