# Structured programming

The first paradigm to be adopted (but not the first to be invented) was structured programming, discovered by Edsger Wybe Dijkstra, which showed that the use of unrestrained jumps (*goto* statement) is harmful to a program structure.

# Object-oriented programming

The second paradigm to be adopted was actually discovered two years earlier, in 1966, by Ole Johan and Kristen Nygaard. The function became a constructor for a class, the local variables became instance variables, and the nested functions became methods. This led inevitably to the discovery of polymorphism through the disciplined use of function pointers.

# Functional programming

The third paradigm, which has only recently begun to be adopted, was the first to be invented. This is the direct result of the work of Alonzo Church, who invented &lambda;-calculus. The notion of &lambda;-calculus is that the values of symbols do not change. This means that a functional language has no assignment statement.

# Food for thought

The paradigms *removes* some capabilities from programmers. It tell us *what not to do*, more than they tell us what to do.
