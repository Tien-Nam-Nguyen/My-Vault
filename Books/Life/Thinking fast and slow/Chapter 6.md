System 1 has a ability to reconstruct the world you live bases on related ideas around with repetition in your life. It reflects the way you define and explain everything.

>If a surprise happened again, it would be less surprised because you had had a idea that it was just a regular thing. Your mind try to connect the second surprise with the first, find the **cause and effect relationship**.

All of that are activated by system 1.

>[!note]
>You can realise abnormal things quickly because it violated the norm that your system 1 define, so that system 1 cannot give you the suitable answer.

>Your system 1 is really good at connecting things to find a suitable cause and effect relationship.

The way your system 1 can find cause and effect relationships is not from the repetition of seeing cases, it is totally natural, even a infant has this.
