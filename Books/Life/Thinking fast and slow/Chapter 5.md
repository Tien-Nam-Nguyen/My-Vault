[[Cause and effect of ease cognition.canvas|Cause and effect of ease cognition]]

When you're in ease cognition (e.g. good mood), you tend to believe more easily, feel trustworthy and familiar, think not carefully and be too naive.

In contrast, when you're in hard cognition (e.g. stress), you tend to carefully check, reconfirm but feel uncomfortable and less creative.

# Memory illusion

>[!info]
>You can feel familiar and recognise things super quickly if you have met those things before, you already have experience even it is false. **Your system 1 create a illusion about familiarity**

# Truth illusion

>[!info]
>You seem to have truth illusion when you believe in your foggy memory, experiences and familiar things about that truth. 

>[!example]
>When you do a multiple-choice test, you tend to choose more familiar choices than other choices on some questions that you don't know.

# Persuasive message

If you want to write a message to persuade someone, you should apply ease cognition to reach this goal: **do not make their hard cognition activate**

- Your message should be easy to read and see. (e.g. nice, bold font, nice paper, nice colours, ...)
- Use simple, easy-to-understand words.
- Use poetry or simple short rhythmed sentences
- Use easy-to-pronounce names

>[!note]
>Whenever you feel stressful, even a little, your system 2 activated.


Remember the "bat and ball" example, in another experiment, student at Princeton were given 2 questions in one of two type of font: normal font size or small font size. The result is students who answered with smaller font size have much smaller rate of having wrong answer. **System 2 was activated even if it met a small stress**

>You are happy when you met something that you already have experiences or something are easy-to-pronounce.

>[!note]
>If you see something repeatedly, you will like it unconsciously


Every animal have this effect. It is describe like this: this effect can happened only if some new factor, through many repetition and experiences become familiar to that animal. That animal will see that factor as a safe factor, not as dangerous factor like before.

Your emotion and ease/hard cognition have a strong correlation to each other.

>If you're happy and having a good mood, your system 1 and ease cognition works way better than when you're having negative emotions. The opposite direction can also happen

>[!note]
>Ease cognition goes with happiness, creativity, system 1. Hard cognition goes with negative emotions, suspicion, carefulness.

Good mood is a sign of good directions, safety environment.
