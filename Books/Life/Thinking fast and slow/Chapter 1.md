# Two system introduction

First example, a picture of a woman facial that is in rage. You can immediately recognise it by system 1 because it always works without trying.

The second example, a complex multiplication equation you need to solve. You cannot give the answer right away but trying to multiply it by your knowledge and experience with multiplication from the past. That's how system 2 work, it works with concentration and trying. It's much more difficult than system 1, when you have to track the calculation and have pressure to answer it right that moment.

**System 1**: quick and automated without trying. It also cannot be controlled.
**System 2**: think with concentration. It attaches with experience, choices. It's usually terrible

You are mostly system 1, not system 2. System 1 is the origin that create trust and careful choices of system 2.

>System 1 can create some very interesting and complex idea, but just system 2 can reconstruct those ideas step by step.
>**In some cases, system 2 can take control and win system 1**

>[!note]
>System 2 can change the way system 1 work by adding some little constraint (e.g. you learn how to drive in left side in England)

We all have limitation in concentration. Our social behaviors also support it.

You can be "blind" temporarily when you're highly concentrate (The Invisible Gorilla). **You totally can be blind before a clear truth or blind about yourself**

# How does two system interact ?

System 1 receives and sends impressions, emotions, ... to system 2.  If it is confirmed by system 2, it becomes trust and is motivated to become a automated action. So that you usually trust your system 1.

System 2 is called when system 1 cannot solve the problems first, or those problems violate the world in system 1 (surprise). System 2 is also responsible for guiding and controlling your behaviors.

System 2 can also appear when you realise you just make a mistake and try to fix it. It usually gives the last decision.

>These two system work perfectly with each others. However, system 1 can still have some system fraud, which usually appear in specific situation. It prefers to answer easy questions than hard, statistical, logic questions. 

>[!warning]
>**You cannot turn off your system 1**


System 2 keeps us from automated wrong answer from system 1. It controls ourselves to not be a "bad guy" (e.g. sometimes your system 1 want somebody to go to hell :))

You need to use your system 2 to prevent yourself from illusions of system 1. Be suspicious. In many cases, you are wrong without knowing because you're in system 1.
