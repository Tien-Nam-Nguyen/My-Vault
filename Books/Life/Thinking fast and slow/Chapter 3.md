>Coherent thinking, solving problems in long time are really hard and need self-discipline. Because of "minimum effort" effect, you cannot concentrate and keep playing around when you bored.

But there's still a form of doing these things in a long period of time without boring or discouragement, called "flow". It's described as working with happiness and infinite passion, infinite energy.

>All human have a pool of mental energy for all of their activities and actions. If you performed a highly-focus activity, you would spent a amount from this energy pool and it would gradually dwindle. After that, it's hard for you to perform that kind of activities as your pool had been empty.

**Glucose in your blood are also decreased when you're using this pool's energy. So if you're hungry, your decision is very superficial**

Human tends to be too lazy to reconfirm answers that come easily and immediately. We are easy to satisfy easy-to-come answer. We try to avoid thinking using system 2 because it's lazy.

>There's no way to prevent easy-to-come answer to come up in your mind. Instead of believing, you should learn to suspect and proactively reconfirm it.

>While you're working with system 2, system 1 can take place and do stupid, superficial things without thinking.

>People who have good self-discipline and self-control with system 2 are usually more intelligent and successful.
