>Your system 1 always give some statement, questions at any given time to survive, which is inherited from the ancient time by evolution

System 1 gives basic, overall statement about everything automatically, even you don't need it.

>[!example]
>We look at faces of politicians to judge and vote for them based on facial features that we think make a good politician

>[!note]
>Your system 1 is very good at making general judgements, but is bad at detailed calculations.

>[!info]
>Your system 1 can easily give a comparison about two unrelated things based on their level.

>[!note]
>System 1 usually let some unwanted, unmeaningful missions interfere in main mission. The mission is overcalculated
