Ram Gopal is a Yogi that can treat all the illness. He created a Ashram (đạo viện) and received many patients from all of the classes to live in there and treat their illness. He had shared a lot about his treatment style:
- Patients should give up all of their current life, include all of fame, money, family to completely being peaceful, so that they can remove all the burdens.
- Greed, lust, ambition destroys our nerve system. It make us lose ourselves.
- We cannot bring our family, money with us after we die
- Western medical methods is just the temporary way to prolong the illness without solving the true root.
- A strong body cannot have illness
- Eating in a simple way without spice, resting of heart, liver, kidney, stomach help our body to recover and detox.
- In every path you are going, you always recheck and ask yourself have you did anything wrong. A single minor mistake can lead us to a completely wrong path.
- Don't attach yourself to trivial things in regular life. It just leads us to the pain
