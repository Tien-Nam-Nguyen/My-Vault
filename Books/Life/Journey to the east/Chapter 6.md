Harishchandra is not only a Yogi but he is also a artist. He can do everything from music, poem, painting,.. He explained it like this:
- Art is presence, it is in everywhere in our life. If art is detached from life, it is just superficial, shallow thing.
- Everyone has different thought, they are affected by it without knowing. The love of art is affected by this prejudice, which make creativity gradually disappear.
- The successes, lust make their ego bigger and from that moment, their become a machine without soul. They cannot see or create the beautiful art anymore.
- Lust make artists scare of new things.
- Creativity come from the disappear of ego.
- You should feel the emotion of the artist inside a piece of art, do not compare it to others.
