Spalding went to a snake show (cheap trick) where he met a strange Indian guy that know almost everything about the scientist group. He had a conversation with Spalding about following common questions:
- Can Rishies make supernatural miracle?
Yes, they can do but rarely. It is just side effect.
- Why Rishies don't teach humanity?
Because no one would believe without visual miracle.
- Why Rishies live alone, separate from society without helping humanity?
They are still helping our human race but without a visual physical body. They help us by releasing positive enerygy, love and charity. In the past, human is completely lost, so they must appear to teach, guide them. Now we must stand by our own feet.
