Hatha Yoga is a small part of Yoga which focus in training and total control physical body
Resting is the core of Hatha Yoga. If you train properly, you can attain a healthy body. There are 4 ways:
- Nghỉ ngơi xoa dịu
- Tĩnh tọa tập trung ý chí
- Điều tức tẩy uế
- Khí công khiển hơi thở

There is a mystery powerful energy running through all of us. An organ is weak is because it lack of this energy. Illness is caused by unbalance of this energy in our body. Through breathing and right posture we can bring this energy to travel through our body. 

Breathing is just a appearance form of this energy. Nerve system is the true key guide to spirit world.

In nature, breathing is the most important factor in longevity, which can be seen clearly in animal. Slow breathing leads to longer life.

If you can practice this to highest level, you can fully control all of the organs and become immortal. Becoming immortal by no longer breathing. 

**Immortal is not a goal of Hatha Yoga**. Immortal is necessary for Yogi to have longer time for training their mind, which is much much harder.

You must view everything in general, look into their good points and try to understand their view.
