Jain is a religion which is just developed in the rural area of the north India. It is a special religion if compared to others, especially in the way Jain's monk practice spirit ritual, which is considered very negative.

- Their life cannot have anything that relate to killing, everything they use, eat, wear must be as natural as possible.
- They live in the jungle with animals, trees, insects without killing them. They just eat vegetables, fruits and meditates all days by themselves without books or guides.
- They look into they soul, find inner peace because gods is actually inside every body. If you can unite yourself with god, let your ego go, find your own path to enlightenment, you can attain true power, true happiness which the outside things can offer to you.
- Everyone has their own paths, don't rely on anything.
- **Silence is the key to wisdom and enlightenment**
