Ramakrishna is a famous monk who had never gone to school. He had attain a state called "Vô ngã". When people attain this, their soul will never be affected by outside event, no matter in any circumstances.

Happiness comes from the inside, not outside. This is true with unhappiness too. It comes from the ignorance of ourselves. Outside just leads us to ignorance. If scientist discovered something  which not came from human nature, that is not the true knowledge.

**The failure of science is the scientists assume that they know everything, so they don't have to discover about themselves**

All the people having knowledge, fame, degree are usually selfish, arrogant, they do not try to dig in problems further, practice it deeper. That is just the understanding from surface of that knowledge, not the true knowledge.
