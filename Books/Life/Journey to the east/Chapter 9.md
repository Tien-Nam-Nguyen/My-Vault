Hamud, a Egyptian wizard insists that the after life world is real. He showed and explained the logic to the scientists:
- There's many level of atom vibration, our world is divided by this seven level of this vibration. Lower frequency cannot meet the higher frequency. High frequency can visit equal or lower frequency levels. There's no other way around.
- The higher frequency the more noble, the more better that world is. That world is just for the good, full of love people live in.
- If you died, you go into one of those level based on your life is good or bad
- Souls of dead people still live around us, they can still see us, even know our feeling, emotion and thinking.
- They are attracted by your lust and behavior. If you are a glutton, glutton soul will be attracted to you closer and vibrate the same "glutton energy" with you. 
- The praying is very meaningful to souls if you place all of your heart on to that praying.
